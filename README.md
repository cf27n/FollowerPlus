# FollowerPlus
Small plugin for Streets of Rogue that adds some extra functionality to followers for a more appealing follower-oriented playstyle.

Currently in alpha. Primarily a concept project.

Current features:
  - Inventory Management
    - Extra interaction button that opens a follower's inventory, allowing a player to retrieve items they have given.
    - Visual indicators of what items are / are not allowed to be retrieved from a follower
    - Works in local multiplayer, unconfirmed in Online play.
